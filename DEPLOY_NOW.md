## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**If deployment fails:**
1. Check Streamlit Cloud logs
2. Verify `app.py` is in root folder (not in subfolder)
3. Check `requirements.txt` has `streamlit` and `graphviz`
4. Try redeploying (click "Redeploy" in app settings)

**If diagrams don't show:**
- Graphviz might not be installed on server
- Alternative: Use Plotly or Mermaid instead (ask if needed)
